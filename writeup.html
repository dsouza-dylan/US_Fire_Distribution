<h1>What have you done so far? </h1>

<p>
Our group has chosen to extend project 3 for the final submission. Right now, our project explicitly focuses on data from 2024 and we are now focusing on unique elements within the data that tell a surprising story. For example, we found that there was a trend where the sheer quantity of fires did not all occur in the west coast as many people know, but only the really bad fires occurred in the west coast were a lot of non-major fires in the eastern area of the country.
In finding interesting events in 2024 wildfires, we are making sure that we use the And, But, Therefore framework to best portray the narrative we are aiming to construct.

<h1>What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?</h1>
<p>
Given our experience with interaction in Project 3, we anticipate that the most challenging part of this project will be the filtering and actually leading the user to follow our interactive visualization. With the And, But, Therefore framework, we want to ensure the interactive elements are intentional, yet flexible. We think narrowing down a few interesting observations and integrating the scrollytelling is a positive step in this direction, but anticipate more challenges in integrating annotations and images (more so with the flexibility, positioning, and rendering) than the actual content itself. Moreover, we want to put forward emphasis on the rendering of data. If our interactive design lags, causes frustration (from bugs), or in any way inhibits the ability to convey our point properly, it will further weaken our chance of persuading the viewer of our perspective. As such, we will likely face challenges in managing our data at the backend. Right now, we simply use 50 CSV files, but this is likely too convoluted and specific to generalize to the final goal we have in mind. Appending specific images for fires would further complicate this process. Furthermore, ensuring that this animation provides an equally positive user experience on multiple devices adds another layer of difficulty which can only be remedied by trial and error.
